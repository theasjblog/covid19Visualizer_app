## Introduction

Simple data visualizer for COVID-19 spread.

## Data

Data is provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and is obtained from <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>. 

JHU university refreshes the data daily, and new data is fetched every day.

## Plots

Once the data is loaded, a set of controls will become available to filter and the dataset and produce plots for specific combination of metrics (`cases`, `deaths` and `recovered`) and countries.

## Maps

As for plots, a number of maps can be produced to visualize the spread of COVID-19 across the globe.
