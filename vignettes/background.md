## Introduction

Simple data visualizer for COVID-19 diffusion.

## Data

Data is provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and is obtained from <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>. 

JHU university refreshes the data daily, and new data is fetched every time the app is loaded.

## Data exploration

Once the data is loaded, a set of controls will become available to filter and the dataset and produce plots for specific comination of metrics (cases, deaths and recovered) and countries.

The plots can be plot in linear of log10 scale.

It is possible to plot raw numbers of cases/deaths/cases, or the rate, which is calculated as the difference in the number at any given day minus the number at the day before.
